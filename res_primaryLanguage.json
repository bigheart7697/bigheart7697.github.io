      "description": "I'm Reza Bigdeli. I have recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree from Sharif University of Technology in Software Engineering in 2020. I am mostly interested in 1) research on topics related to Algorithms and Combinatorial Optimization 2) web application development. I have gained experience in both areas through my studies and internships. As a researcher, I have done research in areas like Computational Geometry, Graph Theory, and Approximation Algorithms. In internships and web development projects, I have worked with technologies like Django, Django Rest Framework, React, Redux, Angular, and Postgresql. Currently, I am looking for a Sofware Engineering job - preferably as a full-stack developer - in Canada.",
